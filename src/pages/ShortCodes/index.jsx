      Below listed shortcodes are powered by Easy Bootstrap Shortcode plugin. To find out more about this plugin and download it please visit WordPress plugin repository. We have made examples for all shortcode types but you can combine them, tweak them, add custom classes and much more. It is among the most powerful Bootstrap plugins to manage shortcodes and we highly recommend it for Dazzling and our other Bootstrap based themes.
